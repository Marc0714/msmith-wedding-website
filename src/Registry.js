      <p>We're so excited to share this day with you and appreciate your generosity.</p>
      <p>We've lived together for several years and have accumulated about everything we need. </p>
      <p>The greatest gift you could give us is a once-in-a-lifetime experience together by contributing to our honeymoon fund. However, we have included a few upgrade items on this list if you'd prefer to gift us something more tangible.</p>
      <p>The thing we're most excited about is to spend time with you on our special day! </p>

      <p>We're so excited to share this day with you and appreciate your generosity.</p>
      <p>The greatest gift you could give us is to contribute to our honeymoon where we will have a once-in-a-lifetime experience together in Chile.</p>
      <p>We will be traveling to explore the Patagonia area where we will be spending a week hiking/snowshoeing (it will be winter there) through the Andes mountains.</p>
